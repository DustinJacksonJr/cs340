Project Two



I try to write programs that maintainable by putting ecessive comments so that I know exactly what each line of code is doing for me within the program. While I was writing the crud method I really explained each line of code so that I can refer back to what I needed to change in the future. The advantages of working this way keeps me organized and on track when it is time to update or go back to a program. Latly I approach problems in a way that i know i will be able to create something to solve a problem to make a users life easier. A client requests is the most important part to me. I find it satisfying to be able to meet their needs. Computer scientist in my opinion are creators that smooths out day to day processes.
